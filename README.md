# Core
Planned code mod for Software Inc.


## Planned features:
- Replace the Code/Art 0-100% in project box on the right with lines of Code and kB/MB/GB of Art, both based on the year of development started.
- Build anarchy, achieved by setting all the build boundaries of furniture to [null] after Ctrl+A is toggled.
- Other things that I can come up with later
